## Criteria
- Low implementation effort
- High usability and outcome
- Coding-focused to improve developer workflows

## 1. Smart Test Generator

### Description
Automatically create unit tests for Python functions based on their signature, docstring, and usage patterns. Using the LLM, it analyzes function logic to generate test cases that cover edge cases, input validation, error handling, and expected outputs.

### Rationale
- **Low Effort**: Leverages existing PythonAnalyzer infrastructure and code review workflow
- **High Usability**: Accelerates test-driven development (TDD) and ensures high test coverage
- **Coding Focus**: Directly improves developer workflow by reducing boilerplate in writing tests
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Can reuse prompt templates, LLM API integration, and file handling

### Implementation Path
1. Create a new CLI command `sokrates-generate-tests`
2. Extend PythonAnalyzer to extract more detailed function information
3. Use existing prompt refiner and LLM API components
4. Generate test files in the `tests/` directory with proper structure

## 2. Intelligent Code Completion Assistant

### Description
Provide context-aware code completion suggestions as developers write code. This feature would analyze the current code context, imported modules, and project structure to offer intelligent autocomplete suggestions that go beyond simple syntax completion.

### Rationale
- **Low Effort**: Can leverage existing PythonAnalyzer and LLM infrastructure
- **High Usability**: Significantly speeds up development time and reduces errors
- **Coding Focus**: Directly improves the coding experience in real-time
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Can integrate with existing code analysis tools

### Implementation Path
1. Create a new module for code completion analysis
2. Integrate with existing PythonAnalyzer for context understanding
3. Develop LLM prompts for generating completion suggestions
4. Create CLI tool or editor plugin interface

## 3. LLM-Based Security Vulnerability Scanner

### Description
Analyze code for security issues based on common vulnerability patterns. It would use LLM understanding to detect potential issues like injection vulnerabilities, improper error handling, or insecure API usage that might not be caught by static analysis.

### Rationale
- **Low Effort**: Can extend existing code review workflow
- **High Usability**: Provides human-readable explanations for security issues
- **Coding Focus**: Improves code security and reduces vulnerabilities
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Can reuse code analysis, prompt templates, and LLM integration

### Implementation Path
1. Add a new review type to the existing code review workflow
2. Create security-specific prompt templates
3. Extend CLI with security analysis options
4. Provide detailed vulnerability reports with fix suggestions

## 4. Context-Aware Code Documentation Generator

### Description
Automatically generate detailed inline documentation and docstrings for Python functions, classes, and modules by analyzing the actual code content. Unlike simple auto-documenters, this one understands semantic meaning from imports, usage patterns, and system context.

### Rationale
- **Low Effort**: Builds on existing PythonAnalyzer capabilities
- **High Usability**: Eliminates manual documentation overhead and encourages better code hygiene
- **Coding Focus**: Improves code quality and maintainability
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Can reuse AST parsing, file handling, and markdown generation

### Implementation Path
1. Extend PythonAnalyzer with docstring generation capabilities
2. Create a new CLI command `sokrates-generate-docstrings`
3. Use LLM to generate context-aware documentation
4. Integrate with existing file helper utilities

## 5. Automated Bug Detection and Fixing Assistant

### Description
Analyze code execution failures, error messages, or warning logs to automatically categorize and track code issues, generate potential root cause explanations using LLMs, and suggest solutions or fixes based on patterns in error messages.

### Rationale
- **Low Effort**: Can leverage existing LLM integration and error handling
- **High Usability**: Accelerates debugging by identifying root causes faster
- **Coding Focus**: Directly improves the debugging workflow
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Can integrate with existing logging systems and error handlers

### Implementation Path
1. Create a new module for error analysis
2. Develop LLM prompts for bug detection and fixing
3. Integrate with existing file helper and LLM API components
4. Create CLI command for bug analysis with fix suggestions

## Various features

### Flow explainer
This feature allows specifying a source file and a class or function name.
The flow explainer should load the according source file, understand it's functionality and specifically look at the flow of data in the implementation.
It should print a list of all initialization of other classes and functions with their according file paths and line numbers of the class definitions and function definitions
It should repeat this process iteratively for calls within the other classes and functions until the data flows back to the initial function or class.
Then it should print a markdown document visualizing and describing the flow of data through the whole code base.
It should not include the file paths of external library classes and function, BUT it should include the library names with the line numbers importing them and calling them.
